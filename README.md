Odin Project HTML Recipes Mock-Up

    This project will follow the Odin Project's recipe project to engrain the pricniples of HTML,

    Having finished this, we should have a basic understanding of HTML formatting of a mock-up website that can loop to relative links within our git (odin recipes)

    As well, this website will be hosted on GITHub for fellow users and possible recruiters to look at and see the development of my finesse in HTML.
